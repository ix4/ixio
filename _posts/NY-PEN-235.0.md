<li>(b) it depicts or describes in a patently offensive  manner,  actual  or  simulated: sexual intercourse, criminal sexual act,  sexual bestiality, masturbation, sadism, masochism,  excretion  or  lewd  exhibition  of  the  genitals,  and</li>
<li>( c ) considered as a whole, it lacks  serious literary, artistic, political, and scientific value.
