### Baer v. Tompkins County, Tomkins County Legislature, et al., Supreme Court, Tompkins
County, Index No. EF2018-0048 (June 7, 2018)

Court held that County violated the OML by inadequately describing the purpose for entering into executive session by “simply stating the reason for entering into executive session was to ‘discuss a personnel matter of a particular person.’” However, the Court also found that the technical violation did not rise to the level of support of an award of attorney’s fees and that Petitioner had not shown the requisite “good cause” for declaring the County’s actions to be void (the County’s actions were not “void but, rather, voidable.”).

### Matter of Gedney Assn. v. City of White Plains, 147 A.D.3d 938, 48 N.Y.S.3d 177, Appellate
Division, Second Department (February 15, 2017)

No violation of the OML when a city council made revisions to a draft findings statement made between two open meetings. The evidence demonstrated that the revisions made to the draft findings were based upon discussions between the members of the Common Council individually and the corporation counsel.
Because there was no quorum present at the time of these discussions and the revisions of the draft findings were posted on the City’s website in advance of the meeting there was no violation of law.

### Matter of Krauss v. Suffolk County Board of Elections, 153 A.D.3d 1211, 61 N.Y.S.3d 569,
Appellate Division, Second Department (September 6, 2017)

Appellate Division upheld Supreme Court determination: “Here, even if the Board's meeting to review
objections to the petitioner's designating petition, which did not involve deliberation on a matter of public
policy, could be deemed subject to the Open Meetings Law, the petitioner failed to show good cause why,
as a sanction for any technical violations of the Open Meetings Law, the Supreme Court should have
exercised its discretion to invalidate the Board's determination.”

### Lipsitz v. UBF Faculty-Student Housing Corp., Supreme Court, Erie County, Index No.
808537/2017 (January 3, 2018)

Court relied on Quigley v. University at Buffalo Foundation, Inc. decision in determining that
respondent Housing Corporation, a not-for-profit created to support the purposes of the University at Buffalo by acquiring, constructing, renovating, and maintaining residential and other facilities for the use
of the University’s faculty and students, was not an agency subject to FOIL nor was its governing body subject to the OML.

### Lucas v. Board of Education of East Ramapo Central School District, Supreme Court,
Rockland County (October 5, 2017)

Court held that Board of Education violated the Open Meetings Law and that “by merely reciting to ‘litigation, personnel, real estate, and contracts’ as the basis for entering into executive session, without describing with some detail the nature of the proposed discussions, the Board of Education has done
exactly what the Open Meetings Law was designed to prevent. Nowhere does the Board of Education identify, for example, the name of the case that will be the subject of the discussion regarding ‘litigation,’ or the name of the property that will be the subject of the discussion regarding ‘real estate.’ Similarly, the
Board of Education fails to identify which ‘contracts’ they will be discussing during executive session or what particular ‘personnel’ issues they will be discussing. As a result, the public lacks the ability to
determine whether the subjects may properly be considered in private.” Court found that petitioners established good cause to declare action of Board approving termination of twenty bus drivers to be void.
Court found that Board “has engaged in a persistent pattern of deliberate violations of the letter and spirit of the Open Meetings Law by, inter alia, improperly convening executive sessions and limiting the public's opportunity to participate at Board meetings.”

### News 12 Co. v. Hempstead Public School Board of Education, 52 Misc.3d 479, 31 N.Y.S.3d
788, Supreme Court, Nassau County (April 12, 2016)

News 12 was prohibited from recording a public meeting hosted by the school superintendent/receiver.
No quorum of school board present. Although the meeting was not subject to the requirements of the OML, Court referenced OML advisory opinions and case law in determining whether school district acted
appropriately in prohibiting use of cameras by reporters. Ordered that superintendent receive OML training.

### Matter of Oakwood Property Management, LLC v. Town of Brunswick, 103 A.D.3d 1067, 960
N.Y.S.2d 535, Appellate Division, Third Department (February 28, 2013)

Court held, “In light of the substantial public input at the August 2011 hearing and the parties' extensive documentary submissions, and in the corresponding absence of any indication that the ZBA intentionally
violated the Open Meetings Law, we find that petitioner failed to establish good cause warranting the exercise of our discretionary power to invalidate the ZBA's determination.”

**Index:** `Action not invalidated`


### Phillips v. Glenville, 475 N.Y.S.3d 62, 160 A.D.3d 126, Appellate Division, Third Department
(April 19, 2018)

Court held that even assuming that the meeting of the Town Board was procedurally defective and violated the Open Meetings Law for failing to sufficiently particularize the subject to be considered during executive session, its actions with respect to plaintiff's employment were “not void but, rather, voidable.”
Court determined that there was nothing in the record that established that defendants intentionally violated the Open Meetings Law and, given that timely notice of the subject meeting was disseminated
prior thereto and the undisputed fact that plaintiff was not reappointed to the office of Comptroller and, therefore, served as an at-will employee, we find that, under the circumstances presented, plaintiff failed
to demonstrate sufficient good cause to warrant exercising the Court’s discretionary authority to invalidate defendants' determination terminating his employment.

### Matter of Ripp v. The Town of Oyster Bay, Index No. 1834-17, Supreme Court, Nassau County
(June 2, 2017)

Petitioner, a resident of Oyster Bay, contended town violated OML in the adoption of two town resolutions. The town argues Petitioner has no standing because he was not aggrieved by the board’s actions. The court disagreed, stating that standing is granted to the citizenry at large. The court also held that with regard to the Town’s failure to make a copy of the proposed resolution available to the public
prior to the meeting, “[t]he Town’s actions with respect to [the resolution] violated the spirit, if the not the letter of the Open Meetings Law...Nevertheless, as this Resolution was adopted to allow payment at a significant savings to the Town, the court does not find good cause to void the resolution.” Court ordered the Town to receive training from COOG.

### In the Matter of Voutsinas v. Schenone, 166 A.D.3d 63288 N.Y.S.3d 62, Appellate Division,
Second Department (November 7, 2018)

Petitioners commenced Article 78 proceeding to compel the Zoning Board to file “corrected” minutes of two meetings held in connection with a Zoning Board determination. The petition alleged that the minutes
of a certain meeting of the Zoning Board violated the Open Meetings Law, as they falsely indicated that a vote approving the petitioners' application for a parking variance was conditioned upon the Zoning
Board's counsel's review of certain covenants and restrictions related to the application, but that no such condition was discussed at the time the vote was taken. Supreme Court dismissed petition and Appellate Division upheld.

Appellate Division opined that “[t]he extraordinary remedy of mandamus will lie only to compel the performance of a ministerial act, and only where there exists clear legal right to the relief sought” (Matter
of Betty Y. v. Brennan, 163 A.D.3d 834, 835, 77 N.Y.S.3d 313; see Matter of Glyka Trans, LLC v. City of New York, 161 A.D.3d 735, 76 N.Y.S.3d 585). Appellate Division held that Zoning Board minutes met the minimum statutory requirements set forth in OML §106 and “[t]o the extent that the petitioners seek to compel the Zoning Board to amend its minutes so as to effect a particular result from the recorded vote, the petitioners have no legal right to that relief (see [Glyka]).”

### Waterloo Contractors, Inc. v. Town of Seneca Falls Town Board, Supreme Court, Seneca
County (September 13, 2017)

The Court found that although the better practice would have been to provide attorney for petitioner with a copy of the documents he requested at the commencement of the meeting or before the meeting, the
failure to do so was a technical violation not warranting award of counsel fees. The Court was persuaded that the reading into the record the information that the petitioner was seeking minimized the effect of denying petitioner copies of the records at the commencement of the meeting.

### Wenz v. Brogan, 149 A.D.3d 970, 53 N.Y.S.3d 127, Appellate Division, Second Department
(April 19, 2017)

Village of Lloyd Harbor Zoning Board of Appeals' (ZBA) failure to record vote of each ZBA member in minutes of meeting, in violation of Open Meetings Law, did not render ZBA's decision to approve area
variance, to which petitioner was opposed, a nullity. Court held that the petitioner was not entitled to relief on the basis of procedural defects in the ZBA's determination.

### Wright v. New York City Council, Supreme Court, New York County, 2017 N.Y. Slip Op.
32629(U) (December 19, 2017)

Petitioner’s motion for preliminary injunction granted as City Council failed to consider and vote on New York County Democratic Party’s recommendation for New York County Democratic Commissioner of the
Board of Elections of the City of New York in open meetings as statutorily required. Court ordered that Respondents were enjoined and restrained, during the pendency of the action, from proceeding with or voting on the appointment of a Commissioner until Respondents comply with the Open Meetings Law and
the Election Law.

Major Decisions


### Abate v. County of Erie, 152 A.D.3d 177, 54 N.Y.S. 3d 821, Appellate Division, Fourth
Department (June 30, 2017)

A request for 911 recordings was made by petitioner via CPLR Article 31 discovery. While court
acknowledged that such recordings may not be disclosed in response to a FOIL request, the court “thus
join[ed] our colleagues in the Second Department in concluding that County Law § 308 (4) ‘is not
intended to prohibit the disclosure of matter that is material and relevant in a civil litigation, accessible by
a so-ordered subpoena or directed by a court to be disclosed in a discovery order’ (Anderson, 134 AD3d
at 1062).”

### Empire Center for Public Policy, Inc. v. NYC Office of Payroll Administration, 158 A.D.3d
529, 68 N.Y.S.3d 716, Appellate Division, First Department (February 15, 2018)

Petitioner’s request for payroll information regarding all NYC employees was granted in part, but the
agency denied access to records reflecting undercover officers’ salaries, contending that disclosure would
pose a security threat to those officers. A January 17, 2017 Supreme Court decision held that agency
failed to demonstrate how the disclosure of the payroll information, without any accompanying identifying
information, would pose a security threat to the officers. Supreme Court ordered disclosure.
Respondents appealed and Appellate Division reversed and dismissed the petition on the ground that
petitioner had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. Petitioner had administratively appealed an
alleged constructive denial, but did not appeal the agency’s determination regarding rights of access.

### Matter of Friedman v. Rice, 30 N.Y.3d 461, 68 N.Y.S.3d 1, Court of Appeals (November 21,
2017)

Court of Appeals clarified the proper interpretation of §87(2)(e)(iii) of FOIL, under which an agency may
seek to exempt from public inspection those records, or a portion thereof, “compiled for law enforcement
purposes and which, if disclosed, would... identify a confidential source or disclose confidential
information relating to a criminal investigation.” Court held “that a government agency may rely on this
exemption only if the agency establishes (1) that an express promise of confidentiality was made to the
source, or (2) that the circumstances of the particular case are such that the confidentiality of the source
or information can be reasonably inferred.”

### Gartner v New York State Attorney General’s Office , 160 AD3d 1087, 75 N.Y.S.3d 102,
Appellate Division, Third Department (April 5, 2018)

There is no legal authority under FOIL to allow a petitioner or independent third party to conduct a search
of an agency's records to locate responsive documents; such a search would be improper because it
would inevitably permit the person to view agency records that were not responsive or that were exempt
from disclosure.


Inter-agency materials exception did not apply to prevent disclosure of communications between Attorney
General's office and counsel for another government entity involved with use of charitable endowments,
when Attorney General's office was not assisting the endowment agency as a government entity in its
endeavors, but instead was involved in the agency's transactions under the Attorney General's statutory
obligations to protect charitable beneficiaries and the public in situations where a trustee or not-for-profit
corporation desires to modify restrictions on a charitable endowment or sell substantially all of its assets.

### Matter of Green v. Annuci, 70 N.Y.S.3d 746, 59 Misc.3d 452, Supreme Court, Albany County
(September 11, 2017)

Video footage of prison incident did not qualify as “personnel record” under Civil Rights Law §50-a, and,
thus, did not fall within scope of FOIL exemption for information specifically authorized to be withheld by
statute. Since video could be used for several purposes, including evaluating an officer, but video was
not used exclusively to evaluate officers, video was record of event and incident that occurred at
correctional facility, depicting actual acts and conduct of individuals, not unsubstantiated allegations or
complaints, and any use of video to subsequently degrade, embarrass, or impeach integrity of an officer
would be due to subjective fault of officer.

### Matter of Jacobson v. Ithaca City School District, 53 Misc.3d 1091, 39 N.Y.S.3d 904,
Supreme Court, Tompkins County (September 23, 2016)

When determining whether the School District could pass along to the requestor the actual cost of
redacting a video recording in order to blur images of students, muffle or obscure student voices, and/or
eliminate references to student names or identifiers, the Court held that a “public agency generally may
not impose its cost of complying with a FOIL request upon the requesting party; however, it may recover
any costs directly associated with redaction of responsive records.” Committee note: “costs directly
associate with redaction” (i.e., blurring/editing a video) should be distinguished from “review of the content
of requested records to determine the extent to which records must be disclosed or may be withheld,” the
“costs” for which the regulations promulgated by the Committee specifically prohibit an agency from
passing along to the requestor (21 NYCRR 1401.8(a)(3)).

128, 57 N.Y.S. 3d 870, Appellate Division, Fourth Department (July 7, 2017)

Court held that Petitioner had standing to seek to compel school board and school district to comply with
her FOIL request for certain e-mail records of superintendent of school district, although FOIL request
was made by petitioner's attorney, where administrative appeal letter expressly stated that attorney was
making the request on behalf of petitioner. Court also held that school district was required to provide
petitioners with requested e-mails under FOIL, with any claimed exemptions from disclosure documented
in a privilege log for review by the court; petitioners reasonably described requested e-mails to enable
school district to identify and produce records, and school district could not evade broad disclosure
provisions of statute upon naked allegation that request would require review of thousands of records.

### Matter of Kosmider v. Whitney, 75 N.Y.S.3d 305, 160 A.D.3d 1151, Appellate Division, Third
Department (April 12, 2018)

Request for copies of the electronic voting ballot images recorded by voting machines was denied by
Respondent County based on an interpretation of the Election Law. Respondents contended records
could only be disclosed by court order. However, the request did not concern the actual paper ballots in
which the votes were cast, but rather electronic copies of those ballots that were transferred to a memory
card. Court ruled that once copies of the paper ballots were transferred to an electronic media and
therefore preserved, the likelihood that the images or data could be tampered with is non-existent and the
request was ordered to be granted. Appellate Division affirmed stating “We conclude that, once electronic
ballot images have been preserved in accordance with the procedures set forth in Election Law § 3–
222(1), there is no statutory impediment to disclosure and they may be obtained through a FOIL request.”

### Lucas v. Board of Education of East Ramapo Central School District, Supreme Court,
Rockland County (October 5, 2017)

Court, in its discretion, awarded attorney’s fees: “Respondent failed to acknowledge receipt of Petitioners'
FOIL requests, failed to either grant or deny Petitioners' FOIL requests and failed to render a decision
with respect to Petitioners' appeals of the constructive denials of their FOIL requests... Rather, only after
Petitioners commenced the within Article 78 proceeding did Respondent eventually provide the
documents requested under FOIL. As such, the Court finds the purpose in permitting an award of
attorney's fees and costs in a proceeding such as this—to deter unreasonable delays and denials of
access—is entirely warranted.”

### Matter of Mazza v. Village of Croton-on-Hudson, 140 A.D.3d 878, 33 N.Y.S.3d 426, Appellate
Division, Second Department (June 8, 2016)

Petitioner made a request to the Village for police records relating to a criminal investigation regarding
allegations Petitioner sexually abused minors. Village claimed entire file was exempt pursuant to Civil
Rights Law 50-b(1). Trial court dismissed the petition and petitioner appeals. Appellate Division held:
“Civil Rights Law § 50-b(1) ‘does not justify a blanket denial of a request for any documents relating to a
sex crime. If a requested document does not contain information that tends to identify the victim of a sex
crime, and the FOIL request is otherwise valid, the document must be disclosed’ (Matter of Fappiano v
New York City Police Dept., 95 NY2d 738, 748). The agency must make a particularized showing that the
statutory exemption from disclosure pursuant to Civil Rights Law § 50-b(1) applies to all the records that
the petitioner seeks.” Appellate Division determined that trial court should have conducted an in-camera
inspection and remanded the case for such review.

### Matter of New York Civil Liberties Union v. New York City Police Dept., --- N.E.3d ----, 2018
N.Y. Slip Op. 08423

Order that compelled the NYPD to disclose redacted decisions of police officer disciplinary hearings
reversed. Appellate court held that since the decisions are made confidential by Civil Rights Law, §50-a
(police officers’ personnel records used to evaluate performance regarding continued employment or
promotion), agency is not obligated to disclose records, even in redacted form. Appellate Division
decision upheld by Court of Appeals

### Matter of New York Times Co. v. New York State Executive Chamber, 57 Misc.3d 40556
N.Y.S.3d 821, Supreme Court, Albany County (July 6, 2017)

Petitioner requested emails ranging from 2011-2016, daily schedules of a state employee, Percoco, from
2011 to 2015, records pertaining to Percoco’s return to the Executive Chamber, and emails between
Percoco and members of the Executive branch staff. Executive Chamber contended that these
documents were exempt because they were compiled for law enforcement purposes therefore, disclosure
would interfere with law enforcement investigation or judicial proceeding. For the law enforcement
exemption to apply, the document must be created, gathered, or used by an agency for this purpose at
some time before the agency invokes the exemption, and the court stated it had done so. However,
Executive Chamber could not demonstrate that disclosure would interfere with an investigation or judicial
proceeding because Chamber has no knowledge of prosecutor’s strategy in the judicial proceeding. The
Protective order issued by another court, the confidential informants, unwarranted invasion of personal
privacy, and state or federal statute exemption do not apply because the Chamber failed to sustain their
burden of proof that the record is exempt.

### Outhouse v. Cortlandt Community Volunteer Ambulance Corps., Index No. 2776-16,
Supreme Court, Westchester County (February 7, 2017)

Records requested regarding an application to become a member of the Volunteer Ambulance Corps.
were denied based on the Corps.’ position that it is not an “agency” as defined by FOIL. The court, relying
on judicial precedent and an opinion prepared by the Committee, granted the petition and stated: “based
on Respondent’s relationship with the town, it is clear that Respondent is performing a governmental
function and is an ‘agency’ within the meaning of FOIL.”

### Matter of Rauh v De Blasio, 75 N.Y.S.3d 15, 161 AD3d 120, 2018 N.Y., Appellate Division, First
Department (May 1, 2018)

Reporters requested copies of correspondences between the Mayor or members of his administration
and a PR firm. Agency denied access asserting the “intra-agency” exemption, claiming the PR firm was
an “agent of the city.” The court ruled that since the mayor’s office did not formally retain the PR firm, the
inter/intra agency exemption would not apply, and ordered disclosure. The court stated: “respondents’
belated production of approximately 1500 additional documents, more than a year after petitioners
submitted their FOIL requests and approximately two months after this proceeding was filed, and their
apparent decision not to claim the exemption with respect to such correspondence in the future, only
underscores the lack of reasonable basis for denying access.” For this reason, the court awarded
attorney’s fees. Decision affirmed in its entirety by Appellate Division.

Police Department,53 Misc. 3d 657, 36 N.Y.S.3d 579). Petitioner filed a motion to reargue the “burden”
issue and both parties requested permission to appeal to the Appellate Division. Motions were granted.
In addition, “respondents [were] directed to review the footage and determine, on an individual basis,


whether the videos are subject to disclosure, and to provide petitioner a copy of those videos that do not
contain exempt material within 60 days after this order is entered.”

### White v. Annucci, Supreme Court, Albany County, Index No. 6326- 16 (July 21, 2017)

The Court found that the proposed fee for "Lt. Review Time" was inconsistent with FOIL as such fee does
not involve the preparation of records, but rather involves the time needed to review the records to
determine what portions must be disclosed or may be withheld. Recognizing that such review is
necessary to protect the safety and security of DOCCS' facilities and to protect the privacy of other
inmates, the Court declined to interpret FOIL and its assorted regulations to include this review time as
time required to "prepare a copy of the requested record" for which a fee may be charged.

### Borukhova v. City of New York, Office of Chief Medical Examiner, Supreme Court, New York
County (December 5, 2017)

Petitioner requested records relating to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner’s (OCME) investigation
into her husband’s death, including autopsy reports. City denied access relying on §87(2)(a) and NYC
Charter §557(g) which governs access to records of the OCME. Petitioner argued that rights of access
should have been governed by NYS County Law 677(3)(b). Court upheld denial and held that NYC
Charter §557(g) has force and effect of state law and governs access to OCME records.

### Bronx Defenders v. N.Y. City Police Dep't, Supreme Court, New York County, May 19, 2017

Court denied respondents motion to dismiss on ground that it had certified that it did not possess any
records responsive to the request. Court determined that there were inconsistencies between agency’s
position that it had certified that it did not possess responsive records and the affidavit of the agency’s
employee regarding the burden of producing a responsive record. Court made reference to 21 NYCRR
1401.2(b)(2), which requires the records access officer to "assist persons seeking records to identify the
records sought, if necessary, and when appropriate, indicate the manner in which the records are filed,
retrieved or generated to assist persons in reasonably describing records." Court ordered respondents to
file an answer to the petition.

Petitioner's request to District Attorney’s office for "unusual occurrence addendums" and "scratch sheets"

### Matter of Castorina v. De Blasio, 56 Misc.3d 413, 55 N.Y.S.3d 599, Supreme Court, Richmond
County (April 3, 2017)

Assemblymembers denied access to application materials connected with the NYC Identity Card
program. The court held that petitioners did not have standing to challenge IDNYC law concerning the
destruction of the records. Respondent stated that disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of
personal privacy, and redacting the personal information would be unreasonably difficult. In conclusion,
the court held: “Petitioners however, have not specifically requested compliance with FOIL and a
response to their FOIL requests. Considering the lack of a formal request, the unduly financially
burdensome nature of the production, and lack of good cause shown, there is no reason for this Court to
order the production.”

Denial by City’s Department of Homeless Services for client-level data upheld by court as records
specifically exempt by state statute (Social Services Law §136). Also, disclosure would constitute
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and could endanger life or safety. Agency withheld RFP and
proposals after homeless shelter conversion project had been discontinued on ground that disclosure
would interfere with a current or imminent contract award. Since project had been discontinued, Court
disagreed and ordered disclosure.

### Cobado v. Benzinger, 163 A.D.3d 1103, 80 N.Y.S.3d 529, Appellate Division, Third Department
(May 29, 2018)

Petitioner requested records relating to his arrest from the New York State Police. Only obtained records
after initiating an Article 78 proceeding. Appellate Division agreed with trial court that the matter was
moot. However, the Appellate Division also determined that respondents failed to comply with the
statutory time frames and that petitioner ultimately substantially prevailed and, as such, overturned the
trial court’s determination that the statutory prerequisites for awarding of attorney’s fees had not been
satisfied. Matter was remitted to Supreme Court for a determination as to whether petitioner is entitled to
counsel fees and/or litigation costs and, if so, to calculate the reasonable amount of any award.

### Matter of Collins v. New York City Police Dept., 55 Misc.3d 1214(A), 58 N.Y.S.3d 873,
Supreme Court, New York County (April 27, 2017)

NYPD denied request for records pertaining to a 1991 murder case on the ground that disclosure would
constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy of the witnesses; would endanger life or safety of
witnesses; interfere with an ongoing investigation; and reveal confidential sources and non-routine
investigative techniques. The petitioner had agreed to receive documents that contained redactions, and
certain witnesses had testified at trial making the NYPD’s argument regarding an invasion of privacy and
confidential sources moot. The argument regarding law enforcement interference failed because the
NYPD could not demonstrate that there was an ongoing investigation. Respondents could not meet their
burden of proof.

Following the Appellate Court's determination on an earlier appeal regarding the disclosure of the
requested records (see Matter of Cook v Nassau County Police Dept., 110 AD3d 718), the petitioner
moved pursuant to Public Officers Law § 89(4)(c) for an award of an attorney's fee and litigation
expenses, and the Supreme Court granted the motion. Appellate Division reversed on the ground that
while the agency was required to disclose certain records, the petitioner had not “substantially prevailed.”

(January 30, 2018)

Appellate Division affirmed trial court’s decision and held that Petitioners' argument that the requested
documents are effectively the final documents relating to a decision not to promote the Petitioners
because there are no later documents providing reasons for the failures to promote, other than the
conclusory notification letters that the candidates were passed over, is unavailing. Respondents explain
that, while the decision makers, including the Chief of Department who was the primary orchestrator,
considered the requested documents in determining whom to promote, no documents exist encapsulating
the final decision, other than the notice to petitioners.

County, Index No. 2063/2017 (November 28, 2017)

Town relied on Pittari in denying access to a variety of Town records on the basis that petitioner was a
defendant in a criminal proceeding and disclosure would interfere with the adjudication of those
proceedings and the statutory provisions controlling discovery. Court held that Town had not met its
burden of proof as to how disclosure would cause the harm envisioned by the statute. Court denied
Town’s request that they be permitted to submit an answer providing additional justification for non-
disclosure. Court determined that petitioner had substantially prevailed and awarded attorney’s fees.

Appellate Division, Third Department (July 28, 2016)

Respondent failed to respond to petitioner’s FOIL request and FOIL appeal. Following the
commencement of the Article 78 proceeding, respondent advised petitioner that 1,356 pages of records
responsive to his request would be sent to him upon payment of the statutory copying fee. Appellate
Court upheld Supreme Court’s dismissal of petition as moot and stated “Where a petitioner receives an
adequate response to a FOIL request during the pendency of his or her CPLR article 78 proceeding, the
proceeding should be dismissed as moot because a determination will not affect the rights of the parties.”

### Empire Healthchoice Assurance, Inc. v. Metropolitan Transportation Authority, 60 Misc.3d
1207(A), Supreme Court, New York County (June 19, 2018)

Court held that contrary to respondents' contention, the statistical and factual data on which respondents
relied when reviewing RFP proposals are not exempt from disclosure. “Public Officers Law § 87(2)(g)
expressly states that “statistical or factual tabulations or data” are not exempt as inter-agency or intra-
agency materials. Presumably, agencies share statistical or factual data because the data might be useful
in the decision-making process. Thus, respondents' analysis would render the exception to the exemption
virtually meaningless.” See also Professional Standards Review Council of America Inc.

2018)

Appellate Division overturned trial court’s order directing the Liquor Authority to disclose unredacted
copies of stipulations entered into between Costco Wholesale Corporation and BJ’s Wholesale Club, Inc.
and the Authority (intervenors). Appellate Division held that the intervenors “met their burden of
presenting ‘specific, persuasive evidence that disclosure will cause [them] to suffer a competitive injury,’

leading to negative publicity.“ (internal citations omitted)

Appellate Division held that trial court had “correctly found that respondent's right to invoke the inter- or
intra-agency exemption to FOIL as to an email message sent to respondent was not waived when the
sender added a third party to the ‘cc’ field of the email and instructed the third party to print attached
materials and deliver them to respondent, in the absence of any expectation that the third party would
review the substance of those materials or disclose them to others.”

Cemetery association sought all records sent or received from any town official, board member, employee
or agent regarding the association’s right to build a cottage on its’ property. The town delivered some
records but withheld others citing attorney-client privilege and the intra-agency exemptions. The records
were submitted to the court for an in-camera review. The court agreed that some records could properly
be withheld. However, the court ordered the town to pay attorney’s fees because it failed to timely provide
the documents, set a date for when the request would be fully answered or give a reasonable basis for
the denial of access to some of the records.

Petitioners requested documents relating to inmate grievances involving physical abuse and/or assault
from seven facilities and the ensuing arbitration orders, decisions, and awards for three years. DOCCS
denied disclosure stating the requested records were not reasonably described, not kept in a format that
permits practical retrieval, and that the records are exempt because they are personnel records used for
evaluating job performance. The court agreed that the records were not reasonably described, because
DOCCS does not have a retrieval system which would allow it to reasonably locate the files; no obligation
to search for a needle in a haystack, and that they are exempt as personnel records used for evaluating
performance under section 50-a of Civil Rights Law.

involving allegations of misconduct by a Town official. Court ordered disclosure (with name of
complainant redacted) and opined that “A blanket exemption from FOIL by a promise of confidentiality
would eviscerate the FOIL statues (sic) and the legislative intent to foster transparency.” Court also
awarded attorney’s fees on ground that “it took two appeals and approximately seven months for the
respondent to release the settlement agreement.”

be produced subject to redaction without violating FERPA, the DOE has established that it, is unable to
do so without unreasonable difficulty because of the undue burden it would place on the agency and the
extraordinary effort it would take.” Court also found that “that the DOE has sufficiently established that it
cannot redact the information prohibited from disclosure by FERPA without unreasonable difficulty and
thus, the remaining records sought in the First Request are exempt from disclosure under FOIL.”

Court offered the opinion that “here it ... seems inconceivable, and at the very least highly improbable,
that the School District did not have and has not maintained any records, beyond a single, one-page flyer
and a few code of conduct and disciplinary code and procedural provisions, that constitute, document,
reflect or otherwise bear on its many efforts - including, but not limited to, gang-related school assembly
programs and student meetings, administrator training in identifying gang-related activity, gang-resistance
education programming, gang-related student disciplinary proceedings and suspensions, online
monitoring related to detecting gang affiliation, activity and messaging, and the provision of instruction to
suspended students - to address gang-related activity in its schools and among its students. Accordingly,
the court finds that the petitioner has demonstrated sufficient factual bases to warrant a hearing as to
whether there exist, or existed, within the School District's control.”

### Levy v. Clarkstown Central School District, Supreme Court, Rockland County, Index No.

pick-up and drop off of the children at their bus stops, the number of children at each bus stop, and the
release of specific addresses where a single home is the location of the pick-up, may endanger the lives
or safety of these children.” However, Court held that the safety exemption “does not warrant an outright
denial of Petitioner’s request under FOIL to provide the bus routes.” Court directed the District to provide
the bus route information, redacted so as not to identify the names of the bus drivers or the children, the
times of pick-up and drop-off, the number of children at each stop, and the specific street number where a
single home is the location of the stop.

Petitioners requested records regarding proposals and bids for a health records service system along
with the scores of the bids, the methodologies for scoring, all internal communication involving the scores
and all communications with bidders. The OPWDD denied the request based on two exemptions, first that
disclosure of these records would impair present or imminent contract awards and second, that they


involved inter and intra agency communications. OPWDD disclosed some records but not all after a bid
was chosen. The court reviewed over 60 documents for in camera review. Court held that agency’s
denial was over-broad. Court granted access to some but upheld agency’s denial of access to others.
Still determined that petitioner had substantially prevailed and scheduled a hearing to determine
attorney’s fees.

NYPD conducted additional searches as a result of petitioner’s commencement of the Article 78

held that petitioner had substantially prevailed. As NYPD failed to respond to petitioner’s appeal within
the statutory time, petitioner had demonstrated his entitlement to attorney’s fees and costs.

Appellate Division, Third Department (June 8, 2017)

Provision of Education Law prohibiting disclosure of records relating to performance of a medical or a
quality assurance review function only shields records from discovery in civil actions and does not protect
them from a FOIL request. However, Statement of deficiencies and plan of correction, as well as
complaint/incident investigation report, compiled by DOH in the course of its investigation of hospital's
treatment of patient, incorporated information collected by the hospital for quality assurance purposes that
was exempt from disclosure under Public Health Law, and thus DOH, in responding to FOIL request,
properly redacted such information pursuant to FOIL exception for records exempt from disclosure by
state or federal statute.

The Appellate Division dismissed petitioner’s appeal as academic. Although “[a] court is limited to
considering only those exemptions to disclosure that are invoked by the party from whom disclosure is
sought” (Matter of Rose v Albany County Dist. Attorney's Off., 141 AD3d 912, 914 [2016]), it is also well
settled that a court “may take judicial notice of a record in the same court of either the pending matter or
of some other action” (Matter of Allen v Strough, 301 AD2d 11, 18 [2002]). Appellate Division noted that
the requested records and exhibits were furnished to petitioner's appellate counsel; therefore, respondent
was under no obligation to furnish additional copies. Court also held that as petitioner received the
requested records through his appellate counsel, whether respondent properly denied his Freedom of
Information Law request had been rendered academic, and the appeal was dismissed.

2018)

Petitioner’s requested copies of records related to the hiring of certain individuals for high-ranking
positions within the police departments of four SUNY institutions. Respondent denied on the ground that
disclosure of the applications would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and that the


applications could not be redacted sufficiently to protect the identities of the applicants. Appellate Court
opined that “it is possible, or even likely, that certain applications, or components thereof, may need to be
redacted in their entirety given the distinctiveness of an applicant's education or employment history;
however, such circumstances with respect to a single, or even several, applicants cannot justify a blanket
denial of the release of 1,344 pages of application information from numerous applicants.” Court directed
SUNY institutions to release the documents sought with sufficient redactions to protect the identities of
the applicants.

Petitioner requested copy of an engineering report. County denied on ground that records were “intra-
agency” material. Subsequent to initiation of the Article 78 proceeding, respondent County disclosed
copy of report. Trial court dismissed entire petition as moot. Petitioner appealed on ground that trial
court should not have dismissed petition relating to costs and fees. The Appellate Division held that it
was unable to conduct the necessary review to determine whether respondent reasonably withheld its
initial disclosure of the report on the ground that it constituted inter- or intra-agency material that was not
“statistical or factual tabulations or data” and remitted the matter to Supreme Court to conduct an in
camera review of the responsive materials provided and determine whether respondent had a reasonable


basis for denying petitioner's FOIL request. Appellate court ordered that if the Supreme Court determined
that respondent lacked a reasonable basis to withhold the subject documents, Supreme Court should
then determine, in its discretion, whether petitioner is entitled to the requested filing fees and costs.

Assistance(OTDA) that discuss or make reference to the applicant. ODTA denied access on the ground
that records were “intra-agency material” (87(2)(g)). Petitioner asserted that “intra-agency material” is not
a permissible ground for denial when records are requested pursuant to the PPPL. The court disagreed
and upheld the agency’s denial of access. Court also determined that the responsive e-mails, while
records subject to FOIL, fell outside the PPPL’s definition of record.

Op. 02206, Court of Appeals (March 29, 2018)

Petitioner requested documents from the NYPD and police commissioner pertaining to investigations and
surveillance activities of the NYPD. Respondent provided a “Glomar” response (neither acknowledging
nor denying existence of records). The Appellate Division held: “we do not suggest that any FOIL request
for NYPD records would justify a Glomar response. "An agency resisting disclosure of the requested
records has the burden of proving the applicability of [a FOIL] exemption" and must submit "a detailed
affidavit showing that the information logically falls within the claimed exemptions" and "the basis for [the
agency's] claim that it can be required neither to confirm nor to deny the existence of the requested
records" (Wilner, 592 F3d at 68 [internal quotation marks omitted]). In view of the heightened law
enforcement and public safety concerns identified in the affidavits of NYPD's intelligence chief, Glomar
responses were appropriate here.”

The Court of Appeals affirmed the Appellate Division and stated: “Thus, in the circumstances presented
here, when confronted with a targeted FOIL request of this nature, a police agency must be permitted to
give a uniform response —to decline to confirm or deny the existence of responsive material in either
scenario—on the rationale that whether or not it is investigating a particular person or organization
constitutes information that is itself statutorily exempt from disclosure.”

A request asking for record keeping and retention, policy guidelines and statistics pertaining to the
surveillance of Muslim individuals, businesses, and organizations throughout New York City and
surrounding areas is exempt from disclosure. Such a request is exempt because it reveals sources and
methods that, if revealed, could create a risk to the safety to officers and their sources. Also, since the
vast majority of records do not include racial, religious, or ethnic classifications and there is no set of
search terms that would encompass the universe of responsive documents, the requests fail to
reasonably describe records of the agency, and the terms are insufficient for the purposes of locating and
identifying the documents sought. Upheld by Appellate Division. Motion for leave to appeal denied by
Court of Appeals.

A.D.3d 1283, 76 N.Y.S.3d 640, Appellate Division, Third Department (May 3, 2018)

Trial court held that respondent OAG must provide more detail regarding its search for responsive
records. Court also held that OAG’s assertion that the records fell within one or more of five possible


exemptions was “nothing more than a parroting of statutory language, and thus a complete failure of its
obligation ‘to fully explain in writing...the reason for denial of access.’” (internal citation omitted). FOIL
request was referred back to OAG for a response within 30 days that fully complied with the intent and
purpose of the law. Appellate Court disagreed and found that the OAG’s response was “sufficiently
complete such that it was unnecessary for Supreme Court to have directed respondent to submit a
supplemental response.” The single record at issue was withheld by the OAG on the ground that it
constituted attorney work product. The OAG also argued that the petitioner did not “substantially prevail”
because it obtained the record through other means prior to initiating the Article 78 proceeding. The
Court disagreed on both points and upheld the Supreme Court’s award of attorney’s fees. However, the
fees were reduced because the Appellate Division disagreed with the trial court that the agency had
stonewalled the requestor.

buildings for evidence of explosives, drugs, and other materials. Supreme Court granted disclosure of
documents pertaining to past deployments, policies, procedures, training materials, aggregate cost, and
number of vans used. However, the Appellate Division held that these materials were exempt based on
the law enforcement and public safety exemptions. NYPD was ordered to disclose tests or reports
regarding the radiation or other health and safety effects of the van as they were not able to articulate a
specific justification for denial. Appellate Division determined that petitioner had not substantially
prevailed and denied attorney’s fees.

2017)

Petitioner requested a summary of a police officer’s personnel record following Eric Garner’s death which
was denied under Civil Rights Law §50-a. Supreme Court held that a summary of a police officer’s
personnel record, which only consists of rudimentary information, is not exempt from disclosure under
§50-a if the information cannot be used to degrade, embarrass, harass or impeach the integrity of the
officer. Appellate Division reversed, holding that a summary of records falls within the parameters of


“personnel records” protected from disclosure under §50-a and because the officer and his family were
facing threats to their safety. Court held that prior disclosure of records concerning other police officers
and release of disciplinary actions in different matters did not create precedent requiring disclosure.

With regard Department of Education’s denial of access to portions of records relating to Education Law
audit standards, the Court of Appeals rejected the Department's reliance on §87(2)(e)(iv) pertaining to
non-routine criminal investigative techniques and so held, for the first time, that because the Department
failed to invoke that particular exemption in its denial of petitioner's FOIL request, it was precluded from
invoking it during an Article 78 proceeding. However, the Court held that the Department’s reliance on
§87(2)(e)(i), (compiled for law enforcement purposes wherein disclosure would interfere with a law
enforcement investigation or judicial proceeding) was justified. Court held that the “law enforcement”
exception was not limited to enforcement of criminal laws.
